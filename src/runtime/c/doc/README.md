# The Hacker's Guide to GF

This is the hacker's guide to GF, for the guide to the galaxy, see the full edition [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).
Here we will limit outselves to the vastly narrower domain of the [GF](https://www.grammaticalframework.org) runtime. This means that we will not meet
any [Vogons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon), but we will touch upon topics like memory management, databases, transactions, compilers,
functional programming, theorem proving and sometimes even languages. Subjects that no doubt would interest any curious hacker.

So, **Don't Panic!** and keep reading. This is a live document and will develop together with the runtime itself.
